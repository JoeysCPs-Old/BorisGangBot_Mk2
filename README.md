# BorisGangBot_Mk2

## Written in C# using Discord.Net and TwitchLib


## What is this?
BorisGangBot is a project of mine to create my own fully fleshed out bot for my friends and I's discord server.


## What are it's functions?
The bot is (or is going to be) capable of:
- [x] Twitch Stream alert notifications
- [ ] Music bot functionalities
- [x] Automatic role assignment through a "roleme {rolename}" esque function
- [ ] Quickly provide information about any twitch stream
- [ ] ...And much much more.


# Update : 6-16-2020
Bot (in branch Exceps+Fixes) is in a somewhat stable state. I believe I've fixed most of the
bugs inside Live Stream Monitor such as duplicate alerts, failing to find streamers, not updating
the streamers list, etc. The code through out the program is still pretty inefficient and hard to
read, but I'll be coming back to that after I finish up cleaning up the bugs.

# Notes on setting up the bot:
The bot requires 3 files placed inside the base directory (where the actual .exe & .dll are). 
The most important one is the \_config.yml file. Inside this file you will set it up as such:
```yaml

```

## Feel free to use any of the code you see!
I apologize for the lack of comments, still working on that. Also, I hope you can ignore
all the inside jokes or weirdly named variables. Please feel free to ask any questions 
by submitting an Issue (pretty good way to get in touch with me) or by some other means
you can think of assuming you can get my info.


Anyways, hope someone finds this useful. Took a lot of time to learn all this but should anyone stumble upon this code
looking for help in writing a discord bot in C#, it should come in handy a decent bit. Enjoy!
