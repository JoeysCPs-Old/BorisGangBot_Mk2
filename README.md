# BorisGangBot_Mk2

## Written in C# using Discord.Net and TwitchLib


## What is this?
BorisGangBot is a project of mine to create my own fully fleshed out bot for my friends and I's discord server.


## What are it's functions?
The bot is (or is going to be) capable of:
- Twitch Stream alert notifications
- Music bot functionalities
- Automatic role assignment through a "roleme {rolename}" esque function
- Quickly provide information about any twitch stream
- And much much more.


# Some things to note:
This bot is very young, and practically still in it's proof of concept phase. I have not gone through and revised the code,
I do not do proper testing i.e. unit testing, and is not in a state where you could host it on multiple servers of your own.
Although, feel free to fork my code and fix my bot to make that a reality! 


I won't be accepting any pull requests right now as this is a 
personal project that i want to see through to the end on my own.
I've learned A LOT of stuff, from async-coding, to service provider,
all the way to optimizing code to get the fastest response time from
command to bot possible. 


## Feel free to use any of the code you see!
I apologize for the lack of comments, still working on that. Also, I hope you can ignore
all the inside jokes or weirdly named variables. Please feel free to ask any questions 
by submitting an Issue (pretty good way to get in touch with me) or by some other means
you can think of assuming you can get my info.


Anyways, hope someone finds this useful. Took a lot of time to learn all this but should anyone stumble upon this code
looking for help in writing a discord bot in C#, it should come in handy a decent bit. Enjoy!
